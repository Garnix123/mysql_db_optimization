# âš¡ Database Optimization in MySQL â€“ Advanced SQL Practice

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This exercise focuses on **optimizing database operations** in MySQL by applying advanced techniques such as:
- **Prepared Statements** for secure and reusable queries
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** for cleaner and more efficient queries
- **JSON Data Handling** for semi-structured data
- **Transactions** for ensuring data consistency  

The project is built around the **Lucky Shrub** database (a landscaping & garden supply business).  
It demonstrates how SQL can be written in a more **optimized, secure, and scalable way** to solve real-world business problems.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The practice uses three core tables:  
- Orders(OrderID, ClientID, ProductID, Quantity, Cost, Date)
- Products(ProductID, ProductName, BuyPrice, SellPrice, NumberOfItems)
- Activity(ActivityID, Properties JSON)

---

## âœ… What was solved:
  - Guaranteed data consistency.
  - Ensured atomicity: either all operations succeed or none are applied.

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack:
  - Database: MySQL
  - Concepts: SQL Optimization, CTEs, Prepared Statements, JSON Functions, Transactions

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Why This Matters:
Optimized SQL queries are essential for:
  - Faster query execution
  - Better security (against SQL injection)
  - Improved data consistency with transactions
  - Flexibility in handling both structured and semi-structured data
This practice simulates real-world optimization challenges in data-driven businesses.
